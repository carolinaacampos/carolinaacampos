# Hi there 👋, My name is Carolina Campos

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/carolinaacampos/assets/blob/main/banner.png" alt="my banner">

My journey begins in the Degree of Computer Science and Business Management, complemented with the Master of Informatics and Management, which allowed me to obtain the theoretical bases on informatics and management.

In order to develop other soft and hard skills that the theoretical classes did not allow to be developed, I decided to get involved with the Junior Enterprise of my university, spending one year as IT Consultant and another as director of this department. Currently, I am a Front-End Developer and I intend to develop myself technically in this area, as well as in UI/UX Design.
